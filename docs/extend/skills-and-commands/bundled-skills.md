title: Bundled Skills
description: Skills that ship inside Claude Code, what each one does, and how to turn them off.

Bundled skills ship inside Claude Code, so you need no files to use them.
They are prompts that guide Claude through a common job.
For example, `/simplify` reviews changed code and fixes the problems it finds.

You cannot change a bundled skill. You can replace one with your own skill of the same name. Turn them off with the `disableBundledSkills` setting or `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS=1`.

## Example

```bash
claude -p "/debug the login test fails on CI"
```

`/debug` enables debug logging. It then investigates the issue that you describe.

## Controls

- The setting `disableBundledSkills` and the env var `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS` remove them.
  The switch is on when the env var is set or the setting is exactly `true` (the program).
  It also empties the list of bundled workflows, so no bundled workflow remains for the `Workflow` tool to run (the program).
  The switch does not turn the `Workflow` tool itself off. Use `disableWorkflows` for that, and see [Agents and Remote Settings](../../configure/settings/agents-and-remote.md). Built-in commands that can be typed, such as `/doctor`, stay available to you.
  The model gets a refusal that names the setting and the env var. Skills from plugins, `.claude/skills`, and `.claude/commands` are not affected.
- Some skills have their own switch. `DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND` hides `/doctor`, and the kill switch above does not remove `/doctor`.
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_API_SKILL` removes `/claude-api`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILL` removes the `claude-code` skill (the program, `chunk-qd604jgh.js`).
  `skillOverrides` can turn off any skill by name.
- When the policy `allow_bundled_skills` is not granted, only names in a fixed list stay.
  The list in the program is: `artifact-diagramming`, `batch`, `claude-code-docs`, `code-review`, `commit`, `dataviz`, `debug`, `explain-usage`, `fewer-permission-prompts`, `keybindings-help`, `loop`, `memory-types`, `plugin-authoring`, `pr`, `simplify`, `update-config`, `verify`, `workflow-authoring`.

## Skill Listing

Claude sees each skill as one line in a listing.
The total budget is on [Skills and Commands](index.md#loading-and-controls).
This table holds the size of one line and the order of the `skillOverrides` values.
Source: the program (`chunk-qd604jgh.js`).

| Item | Status | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size of one line | <Undocumented /> | A full line is a dash and a space, the name, a colon and a space, and the text. That is the name length plus 4 characters, plus the text. The text is the `description`, then ` - ` and `when_to_use` if set. A newline joins two lines. |
| Cap on the text | <Documented /> | `skillListingMaxDescChars` (default 1,536) cuts the text, and the last character of the cut text is `…`. A cut text is never longer than the cap. |
| Name shown | <Undocumented /> | The name is the skill name. When its short name is not the full name and the short name is also a name that finds this skill, the line adds the short name in parentheses. This adds characters to the line. |
| Name-only line | <Documented /> | A dash, a space, and the name only. That is the name length plus 2 characters. A skill set to `name-only` always gets this form. |
| Order of `skillOverrides` values | <Undocumented /> | From shown most to shown least: `on`, `name-only`, `user-invocable-only`, `off`. When several keys of one skill match (its name, an alias, or its short name), the value that shows least wins. |

## Skills

| Skill | Status | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/doctor` (alias `/checkup`) | <Documented /> | Checks your setup: install, unused extensions, `CLAUDE.md`, hooks, permissions. `/doctor prompt-audit` audits instructions. | Hidden by env var `DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND` or `skillOverrides` `"doctor": "off"`. Needs a workspace. Interactive. |
| `/claude-api` | <Documented /> | A reference for the Claude API and Managed Agents in your language. | Subcommands: `migrate`, `upgrade`, `api-version` (new in `2.1.307`: moves Claude API code to API version `2026-10-21`, per the [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.307)), `managed-agents-onboard`, `prompt-audit`, `cost-optimize`, `build-eval`, `hillclimb`, `preserved-thinking-migration`, `managed-agents-secure`. Since `2.1.310`, when two server flags (`tengu_cosmic_sketch` and `tengu_typed_trinket`) turn it on, it also searches the project for deprecated or retired model IDs and lists them in a section "Deprecated or Retired Models in This Project" (the program). The `2.1.311` release diff lists `/claude-api` as removed, but the skill is still in `2.1.311`: the startup code still registers it and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_API_SKILL` still turns it off (`chunk-nxczhwwr.js:5483`), and its definition is in `chunk-cqcx451p.js:325`. Only the way the program registers it changed, so the diff tool missed it. The built-in plugin `cc-plugin-claude-platform` also offers the same skill, only when no bundled skill has that name, and adds a docs MCP server (`chunk-j1r347qy.js:160`, `chunk-j1r347qy.js:183`). |
| `/claude-api managed-agents-secure` | <Documented /> | Compares a Managed Agents agent's settings with Anthropic's published security guide. It changes nothing. | New in `2.1.304`. It is unavailable when Claude Code's check on its `ant` commands does not run. Source: the [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.304) and the program. |
| `/debug` `[issue description]` | <Documented /> | Enables debug logging and investigates. | `disableModelInvocation`. Allowed tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`. |
| `/batch` `<instruction>` | <Documented /> | Plans a large change. Runs 5 to 30 worktree agents that open pull requests. | `disableModelInvocation`. |
| `/run` | <Documented /> | Launches your app so you can see a change work. | Reads a recorded `run-<name>` skill if one exists. |
| `/run-skill-generator` | <Documented /> | Records how to run the project as `.claude/skills/run-<name>/`. | `disableModelInvocation`. |
| `/verify` | <Documented /> | Tries your change and reports if it works. | Records its recipe in `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`. Since `2.1.312`, `/help` and the `/` command menu show the short text "Try your change and report if it works" (`chunk-ktc61wsq.js:5169`). Claude gets the long description (`chunk-ktc61wsq.js:5163`). In `2.1.311` the menu showed the long description (`chunk-nxczhwwr.js:5393`). Source: the [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.312) and the program. |
| `/code-review` (alias `/review`), `/loop`, `/simplify`, `/workflow-authoring` | <Documented /> | Named in the docs. | `/workflow-authoring` needs dynamic workflows. |
| `/plugin-authoring` | <Documented /> | Helps you write and share a mod or plugin. | Since `2.1.304`, sharing no longer stops at the secret scan on machines with managed settings or on Team and Enterprise plans. Source: the [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases/tag/v2.1.304). |
| `/update-config` | <Documented /> | Edits `settings.json`: hooks, permissions, environment variables. | Registered as a bundled skill. |
| `/fewer-permission-prompts` | <Documented /> | Scans transcripts and adds a read-only allowlist to `.claude/settings.json`. | Needs a workspace. |
| `/security-review` | <Documented /> | Reviews pending branch changes for security risks. | A `prompt` command that Claude can also call through the `Skill` tool. Git repositories. |
| `/schedule` (alias `/routines`) | <Documented /> | Creates and manages scheduled remote agents. | A stub with a name, alias, and description. Needs claude.ai. |
| `/keybindings-help` | <Undocumented /> | Helps you edit `~/.claude/keybindings.json`. | `userInvocable:false`, so only Claude runs it. Allowed tool: `Read`. |
| `/claude-in-chrome` | <Gated note="Needs the Chrome extension, or a check passing." /> | Browser automation through the Chrome extension. | No allowed tools. |
| `/design-sync` `[<project hint>]` | <Gated note="Policy allow_design_sync." /> | Pushes design-system components to claude.ai/design. | `disableModelInvocation`. |
