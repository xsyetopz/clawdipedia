title: Files, Nouns, and Gates
description: The files and manifest keys of a mod, every noun on the object $, the settings that stop mods, the limits, and the built-in mods.
sidebar_position: 3
---

A mod has a few files, one object named `$` with 20 nouns, and a short list of switches that can stop it.
The tables below list them all, with the limits that apply.
The one file that makes a plugin a mod is `modules` in `hooks/hooks.json`.
A manifest has no `mods` key.

These switches stop mods: `disableAllHooks`, `allowManagedHooksOnly`, `allowManagedModsOnly`, `--safe-mode`, and `--bare`. A remote rollout switch also gates installed mods. Mods live in the plugin folder, `plugin.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`, and settings files.

## Files and Manifest Keys

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hooks/hooks.json` key `modules` | <Documented /> | The path of the hooks module. | One path only. The module and each file it imports end in `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, or `.cts`. The program says: `hooks.json` `modules` names one hooks module per plugin. | Plugin `hooks/` folder. |
| `register(on, options)` | <Documented /> | The export that the loader reads. The loader reads nothing else. | See [Hooks](events/hooks.md). | The hooks module. |
| Manifest key `types` | <Documented /> | Path to the type contract of the plugin. It starts with `./`. | A self-contained `.d.ts` with no import, export-from, require, or reference. It declares the noun in `declare module 'claude-code' { interface EngineInterface { ... } }` and the `PluginState` values. `claude plugin validate` checks it. | `plugin.json` |
| Manifest key `dependencies` | <Documented /> | Plugins that must be enabled. | A mod that lists a plugin here gets its contract at `.claude-plugin/types/<plugin>/index.d.ts` when the engine loads the mod from a folder the person owns. | `plugin.json` |
| Manifest key `userConfig` | <Documented /> | Fields whose values reach `register` as `options`. | The engine fills in defaults. Values are in `pluginConfigs` of settings. A required field with no value fails the load. `PluginOptions` is a read-only record of string, number, boolean, or string list. | `plugin.json` |
| `.claude-plugin/types/` | <Documented /> | The engine writes `claude-code/index.d.ts`, `claude-code-tools/`, `claude-code-mcp/`, and one folder for each dependency here. | The engine writes them again after an update. The engine skips a file whose text already matches, and replaces a folder that stands where a file belongs. A mod that has no tsconfig gets one that extends `.claude-plugin/types/tsconfig.json`. A mod that has a `jsconfig.json` gets no new `tsconfig.json`, and an existing `tsconfig.json` stays as it is (the program, `chunk-qd604jgh.js@4156331`). | A mod loaded from a folder the person owns. |
| Tests `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` | <Documented /> | `claude plugin test [dir]` runs them. | See [Testing](calls/testing.md). | Plugin folder. |

## The Dollar Object

`$` is the first argument of every hook.
It is frozen.
It has `plugin`, 20 nouns, and every noun that an `engine.create` hook added.
Write each call in full, such as `$.fs.read('notes.md')`.
Each `$` call is also an event with the same name, such as `fs.read`.
A hook on it can pass the call on, refuse it with `{ deny }`, or answer it with `{ value }`.
The dispatch skips the calling hook alone, so a plugin does not trap itself.

## Gates That Stop Mods

| Item | Status | What it does | How it works | Where it can be used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disableAllHooks` | <Differs note="The schema also says it stops the statusLine command. The Hooks Reference names only hooks." /> | No mod or hook of an installed plugin runs. Built-in mods load. | Row: [Hooks, Plugins, and Skills Settings](../../configure/settings/hooks-and-plugins.md#keys). | Settings files. |
| `allowManagedHooksOnly` | <Documented /> <ManagedOnly /> | Blocks hooks and mods that are not the organization's. | The program says: hooks modules are turned off here (`disableAllHooks`, `allowManagedHooksOnly` or a policy). Row: [Hooks, Plugins, and Skills Settings](../../configure/settings/hooks-and-plugins.md#keys). | Managed settings. |
| `allowManagedModsOnly` | <Documented /> | Only organization mods and built-in mods run their hooks. | An option of the built-in guard `sec-default`. | Managed settings. |
| `allowModsToOverrideDenyRules` | <Documented /> | Lets an installed mod approve a call that a `deny` rule refuses. | An option of the built-in guard. | Managed settings. |
| `prependPlugins`, `appendPlugins` | <Differs note="Docs say user or managed scope. The schema says managed only." /> <ManagedOnly /> | Plugin ids that run before or after user mods. | Only these can call `next.to`. Rows: [Hooks, Plugins, and Skills Settings](../../configure/settings/hooks-and-plugins.md#keys). | Managed settings. |
| `disableSideloadFlags` | <Documented /> <ManagedOnly /> | Rejects `--plugin-dir` and `--plugin-url`. | Row: [Hooks, Plugins, and Skills Settings](../../configure/settings/hooks-and-plugins.md#keys). | Managed settings. |
| `--safe-mode`, `--bare` | <Documented /> | No installed hooks module loads. | The program says: installed plugins are disabled, none of their hooks or hooks modules load, built-in plugins load regardless. | CLI flags. |
| Rollout switch | <Gated note="Remote flag, name not shown in the program strings" /> | Installed hooks modules wait for a rollout flag. A message says installed mods are turned off remotely. | Built-in plugins and organization plugins load regardless. | Installed plugins. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIR_WATCH` | <Documented /> | Load plugin dirs as `--plugin-dir` does. Reload on save in a non-interactive session. | None. | Environment. |

## Limits

Hooks and Mod API calls run under time and size limits.
Claude Code skips a hook that is too slow.

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Own time of one hook for one event | 10 seconds, or 50 milliseconds for a `prompt.edit` hook (the program sets it on the event) |
| A `.catch` handler | 1 second |
| All `session.end` hooks together | 1.5 seconds unless you change the `SessionEnd` hook budget |
| `$.process.run` | 30 seconds by default, 10 minutes at most |
| `$.model.complete` `maxTokens` | 1024 by default, up to 64,000 or the output limit of the model |
| `$.fs.read` and `$.fs.write` | 4 MiB for one file |
| `$.http.fetch` body and response | 4 MiB each, 30 seconds, 5 redirects |
| `$.store` | 4 MiB of JSON in all |
| `$.session.messages()` | The newest 4,096 entries |
| `$.ui.invalidate('ui.render')` | 10 redraws a second, or 30 in the terminal for the visible pane |
| `$.ui.toast` | 4 seconds unless you pass `timeoutMs` |
| A pane that nobody asked for | Placed from 144 terminal columns, 110 after the person opened it once |
| Names of commands, tools, subagent types, and panes | Letters, digits, `_`, and `-`, up to 64 characters |
| One `claude plugin test` test | 5 seconds unless the test sets `timeoutMs` |

## Built-in Mods

Claude Code 2.1.316 registers up to 13 built-in plugins at start (the program).
Each id is `cc-plugin-<name>@builtin`.
The settings and flags that stop installed mods do not stop them.

| Name in `/plugin` | What it does | Registered when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cc-plugin-sec-default` | Guards what your organization manages from the mods a user installs. You cannot turn it off. | Always |
| `cc-plugin-agents-md` | Loads `AGENTS.md` as project instructions. | Always |
| `cc-plugin-telemetry` | Sends the analytics records that Claude Code and its built-in mods log. | Always |
| `cc-plugin-plugin-authoring` | Gives Claude the `plugin-authoring` skill for writing mods. It holds no mod code. | `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is not `local-agent` |
| `cc-plugin-mods-guide` | Shows a small panel over the question card when Claude explains how mods work, until you answer the card. | `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is not `local-agent` |
| `cc-plugin-tips` | Shows tips (the program names it `cc-plugin-tips`; this page did not read its text). | Not `local-agent`, and the entry point does not start with `remote` |
| `cc-plugin-mermaid` | Draws Mermaid diagrams (the program names it `cc-plugin-mermaid`; this page did not read its text). | Not `local-agent`, and the entry point does not start with `remote` |
| `cc-plugin-responsive-mode` | Claude replies in one sentence before it thinks or uses tools, on every prompt. | Normal run, or the `remote` entry point |
| `cc-plugin-diff` | Takes over `/diff` and draws its pane. | Not `local-agent`, and the entry point does not start with `remote` |
| `cc-plugin-you-should-know` | Displays a note above the prompt when a side agent finds something you might have missed. Off until you turn it on. | `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is not `local-agent` |
| `cc-plugin-easel` | Draws charts in the transcript. | Normal run, or the `remote_cowork` entry point |
| `cc-plugin-claude-platform` | A built-in plugin of the same registry. | Normal run |
| `cc-plugin-claude-test` | A built-in plugin of the same registry. | Normal run |

Source: the program, `chunk-bxdwwc5h.js@0`, the start function that calls the registry one plugin at a time. "Normal run" means the entry point is not `local-agent` and does not start with `remote`.
A plugin can also hide itself with its own `isAvailable` test.
For example, `cc-plugin-easel` needs Linux or macOS and no `hipaa` or `zdr` data policy (the program).

### Enable Test

The program decides each built-in plugin in this order (`chunk-c27zh2rw.js@76952`).

1. A plugin that fails `isAvailable`, or that failed to load, is not listed.
2. With `enabledFromPolicyOnly`, only the policy settings value of `cc-plugin-<name>@builtin` counts.
3. With `enabledFromTrustedSettingsOnly`, only the trusted settings value counts. `cc-plugin-sec-default` sets both.
4. Otherwise the `enabledPlugins` key of your settings counts. A plugin that a directory you added with `--add-dir` also lists is read by the loader for that case.
5. A value that is set decides: only `true` turns the plugin on. With no value, the plugin uses its `defaultEnabled`, and that is `true` when the plugin sets none.

Only `cc-plugin-sec-default` sets the two policy-only flags in `2.1.316`. The other built-in plugins read `enabledPlugins` from your settings (the program). Only `cc-plugin-responsive-mode` and `cc-plugin-you-should-know` set `defaultEnabled: false`. To turn one on, set its id as the key:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "cc-plugin-you-should-know@builtin": true
  }
}
```

See [Hooks, Plugins, and Skills Settings](../../configure/settings/hooks-and-plugins.md#keys) for `enabledPlugins`.

`cc-plugin-responsive-mode` sets `defaultEnabled: false`. It is also available only outside the Teams surface, and only while a server gate that you cannot set is on (the program, `chunk-mdwf4s3v.js@627`). So turn it on with `enabledPlugins` and expect it to be missing when the gate is off.
