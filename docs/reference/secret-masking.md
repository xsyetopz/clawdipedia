Claude Code masks text that looks like a secret before it shows or records the text.
It replaces the secret with `[REDACTED]`. This page describes the algorithm and the rule table.
It does not list each pattern.
Source: the program (`chunk-3cfs0sm8.js@53752` to `@67138`). Every row is <Undocumented />.

## The Rule Table

One table holds 65 rules. Each rule has an `id`, a `source` pattern, and a `confidence` tier.
Some rules also have a `prefilter` (a cheap test that runs first), a `run` or `displayRun` (a character class for long runs), and `redactOnly`.

| Tier | Rules | What the rules match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `low` | 13 | Context rules. Examples: `url-userinfo`, `sensitive-assign`, `cloud-env-var`, `http-auth-scheme`, `loose-jwt`, `loose-anthropic-key`, `gcp-service-account`. |
| `high` | 52 | Token rules for one vendor format. Examples: `aws-access-token`, `github-pat`, `anthropic-api-key`, `openai-api-key`, the `gitlab-*` family, the `slack-*` family, `stripe-access-token`. |

The table order is the order of use. The `low` rules come first, then the `high` rules, from `aws-access-token` to `shopify-shared-secret`.

## Passes

| Pass | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `redactContext(text, includeRedactOnly)` | First it masks private-key blocks. Then it applies each `low` rule in table order. A `redactOnly` rule runs only when the flag is `true`. A rule with a `prefilter` runs only when the prefilter matches. The marker keeps the key name or prefix, and keeps one pair of quotes around the value. |
| `redactTokens(text)` | Applies each `high` rule in table order. A rule is skipped when its `prefilter` does not match. |
| `redact(text)` | Finds URL ranges first. With none, it runs `redactContext` with `redactOnly` rules on, then `redactTokens`. With URL ranges, it tracks the matches so that the URL stays readable. It caches the result for short strings. |
| `redactForDisplay(text)` | A separate rule set that uses only the `high` tier. It leaves a match alone when the matched text holds a shell character (`$`, a backtick, `\|`, `;`, `&`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, a space) or a path character (`/`, `.`, `@`, `:`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `\`). So a command or a path does not break. |

A `high` rule matches only when no letter, digit, `_`, or `-` comes before it. After it, no letter, digit, `_`, `-`, `+`, or `=` may follow.
A rule with a run class matches a token that is split by a long run of that class, and it reads the whole run.
The program sizes its work on long text in units of 16,384 characters.

## Private Keys

A separate reader looks for the text `-----BEGIN`, with no case check on the word, and any number of extra `-` characters.
It reads each block to its end and replaces the whole block with `[REDACTED]`. It runs before the `low` rules.

## High Tier Rule Names

The `high` rules cover these vendors (`chunk-3cfs0sm8.js`). The `gitlab-*` family has 11 rules, such as `gitlab-pat`, `gitlab-deploy-token`, and `gitlab-ci-build-token`.

| Vendor | Rule names |
| --- | --- |
| Amazon, Google, Azure | `aws-access-token`, `gcp-api-key`, `google-oauth-client-secret`, `azure-ad-client-secret` |
| Anthropic, OpenAI, Hugging Face | `anthropic-api-key`, `anthropic-admin-api-key`, `anthropic-oauth-token`, `openai-api-key`, `openai-legacy-api-key`, `huggingface-access-token` |
| GitHub | `github-pat`, `github-fine-grained-pat`, `github-app-token`, `github-oauth`, `github-refresh-token` |
| Slack | `slack-bot-token`, `slack-user-token`, `slack-rotation-token`, `slack-app-token`, `slack-workflow-token`, `slack-webhook-url` |
| Grafana, Sentry | `grafana-api-key`, `grafana-cloud-api-token`, `grafana-service-account-token`, `sentry-user-token`, `sentry-org-token` |
| Other | `digitalocean-pat`, `digitalocean-access-token`, `supabase-secret-key`, `supabase-access-token`, `twilio-api-key`, `sendgrid-api-token`, `npm-access-token`, `pypi-upload-token`, `databricks-api-token`, `hashicorp-tf-api-token`, `pulumi-api-token`, `postman-api-token`, `stripe-access-token`, `shopify-access-token`, `shopify-shared-secret` |

## Low Tier Rule Names

| Rule | What it masks |
| --- | --- |
| `url-userinfo`, `url-userinfo-tail`, `url-userinfo-later-at`, `url-userinfo-encoded` | The user name and password part of a URL (`://user:pass@host`), also when the `@` is written as `%40`. |
| `sensitive-assign` | The value in `name=value` or `name: value` when the name holds a sensitive word. |
| `sensitive-assign-escaped` | The same, when quotes in the text are escaped with a backslash. `redactOnly`. |
| `cloud-env-var` | The value of a variable that starts with `AWS`, `GOOGLE`, `GCP`, `GCLOUD`, or `AZURE` and an underscore. |
| `http-auth-scheme` | A `Bearer` or `Basic` credential of 20 or more characters. |
| `loose-jwt` | A JSON Web Token that starts with `eyJ`. |
| `loose-anthropic-key` | Text that starts with `sk-ant` and has 10 or more key characters. |
| `gcp-service-account` | A Google service account address that ends in `.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. |
| `masked-value-rest`, `anthropic-signed-key-rest` | The part of a value that stays after an earlier rule masked its start. `anthropic-signed-key-rest` is `redactOnly`. |

A name is sensitive when it holds one of these words, with no case check: `api_key`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `passwd`, `credential`, `bearer`, `authorization`, `auth_header`, `cookie`, `session_id`, `session_key`, `connection_string`, `client_secret`, or a `private`, `ssh`, `encryption`, `signing`, `access`, `deploy`, `master`, or `license` key. The words may be joined with `_` or `-`, or with nothing.

## Where It Applies

No setting or environment variable that turns masking on or off was found in the program.
The list shows the output that a caller masks. Each caller uses one function.

| Output | Function | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lines that the program writes to the log files of an MCP server (error lines and debug lines) | `redact` | `chunk-fqdyq52e.js` |
| The error list and the debug log text of a `/feedback` report | `redact` | `chunk-2vx8vjz4.js` |
| Error message and stack fields of an error report that the program builds, cut to 2,000 and 4,000 characters | `redact` | `chunk-qd604jgh.js` |
| The command, the description, and the reason in a permission request that the program sends to a connected client | `redactContext` and `redactTokens` | `chunk-yhkm4f9e.js`, `chunk-f2wjwatx.js`, `chunk-157f1pes.js` |
| The path and the skill summary in a permission dialog that the program sends to a connected client | `redactForDisplay` | `chunk-157f1pes.js` |
| The preview of tool input, including the field names | `redactForDisplay` | `chunk-f2ccw312.js` |

### Outputs That Keep the Secret

Masking does not apply to the text of your prompt in these outputs.
A probe sent a prompt with a fake GitHub token in the `github-pat` shape (`ghp_` and 36 letters). That shape is a `high` rule.
The full token stayed in each of these outputs:

| Output | Probe setting |
| --- | --- |
| The Messages API request that goes to the model | `-p` against a local stub |
| The session transcript, `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` in the config folder | The same run |
| The OpenTelemetry `user_prompt` log event | `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`, and the `console` logs exporter. A run with no telemetry did not print the token. |

Source: a probe of 2.1.316 with cc-inspect `code` `cli` and `query`, which names each request, stream, and transcript file that holds a text.
The probe covers only the prompt text. The stub cannot make the model call a tool, so tool output was not tested.
To keep a secret out of these outputs, do not put it in a prompt. Without `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS`, the prompt is not in the OpenTelemetry events (see [Telemetry and Debug](../configure/env-vars/telemetry-and-debug.md)).

## Secret Scan

The `scan` function does not change text. It returns the label of each `high` rule that matches, and a `Private Key` label for a private-key block.
A label comes from the rule name. The program spells some words in a fixed way: `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `OpenAI`, `HuggingFace`, `DigitalOcean`, `HashiCorp`, `SendGrid`, `NPM`, `PyPI`, `AWS`, `GCP`, `API`, `PAT`, `AD`, `TF`, `OAuth`, `JWT`, `CI`, and `SCIM`.
Example: the rule `github-pat` has the label `GitHub PAT`.

The program uses the scan in two places.

| Place | Result |
| --- | --- |
| A write to a memory file (`chunk-5nk5tezb.js`) | The write fails with `Content contains potential secrets (<labels>) and cannot be written to memory.` The text then names the reason. A team memory file says that team memory is shared with all repository collaborators. A memory file says that memory is synced to your account. |
| A command in an auto mode denial notice (`chunk-80aypj4n.js`) | When the scan finds a secret in the command, the tool input, or the reason, the notice shows no command and no reason. The notice also shows none when the check itself fails. |
